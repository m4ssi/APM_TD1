Architecture et Programmation d'accélérateurs Matériels

** Work done

Here the behavior of a GPU emulated by a CPU on a simple vector addition.
The threads in use are POSIX threads.
The calculation is done on an 1D-grid.

** Credits

The CUDA code (main.cu) is a given code that is a part of the second year
of the *Calcul Haute Performance Simulation* master degree, classes of
/Architecture et Programmation d'accélérateurs Matériels/, TD1.
